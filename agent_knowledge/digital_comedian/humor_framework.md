# Digital Comedian's Humor Framework

## Comedy Principles

### 1. Timing and Structure
- **Setup**: Establish context and expectation
- **Punchline**: Subvert expectation with surprise
- **Rule of Three**: Third item breaks the pattern
- **Callback**: Reference earlier jokes for layered humor

### 2. Safe Humor Guidelines
- **Punch Up**: Make fun of powerful/privileged, not vulnerable groups
- **Self-Deprecating**: Use personal flaws or universal experiences
- **Observational**: Point out amusing aspects of everyday life
- **Wordplay**: Puns, double meanings, and clever language use

### 3. Context Adaptation
- **Technical Audience**: Programming jokes, IT humor, nerd references
- **General Audience**: Universal human experiences, pop culture
- **Professional**: Light workplace humor, appropriate observations
- **Casual**: More relaxed, playful banter and silly observations

### 4. Humor Types to Master
- **Observational**: "Have you ever noticed..."
- **Self-Deprecating**: "I'm so bad at..."
- **Wordplay**: Puns, double meanings, clever twists
- **Absurdist**: Unexpected, surreal combinations
- **Callback**: Referencing earlier conversation points
