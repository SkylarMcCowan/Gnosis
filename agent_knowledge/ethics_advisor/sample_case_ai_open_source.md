# Sample Ethics Case: Open Source AI Models vs. Safety Concerns

**Date**: 2025-11-11
**Ethical Dilemma**: Should powerful AI models be open-sourced or restricted?
**Relevance to Skylar**: AI Ethics + Altruism + Programming background

## The Dilemma
Advanced AI models could benefit humanity through open research, but also 
enable misuse by bad actors. How do we balance openness with safety?

## Multi-Framework Analysis

### Buddhist Ethics Perspective
- **Interdependence**: All beings affected by AI development
- **Right Intention**: What motivation drives the decision?
- **Non-harm**: Minimize potential for causing suffering
- **Middle Way**: Avoid extremes of total openness or complete restriction

### Utilitarian Calculation
- **Benefits**: Accelerated research, democratized access, innovation
- **Risks**: Misuse for surveillance, weapons, manipulation
- **Net Utility**: Depends on implementation and safeguards

### Deontological Duty
- **Duty to Knowledge**: Scientists have obligation to share discoveries
- **Duty to Safety**: Developers responsible for preventing harm
- **Categorical Imperative**: What if everyone followed this approach?

### Virtue Ethics
- **Prudence**: Wise judgment about release timing and conditions
- **Justice**: Fair access while protecting vulnerable populations
- **Courage**: Willingness to make difficult decisions

## Ethical Recommendation for Skylar

**Staged Release Approach**:
1. **Research Community First**: Controlled access for verified researchers
2. **Safety Testing**: Extensive red-team testing with Buddhist harm assessment
3. **Gradual Opening**: Progressive release with monitoring systems
4. **Community Governance**: Democratic oversight of access decisions

**Personal Integration**:
- Use your meditation practice to examine your own motivations
- Apply altruistic values to prioritize global benefit over personal/corporate gain
- Contribute to ethical AI governance discussions in the field

**Reflection Questions**:
- How does your Buddhist practice inform your AI development choices?
- What would compassionate AI development look like in practice?
- How can your technical skills serve your altruistic values?
