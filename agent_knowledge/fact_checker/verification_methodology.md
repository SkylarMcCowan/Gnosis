# Fact Checker Methodology

## Source Verification Framework

### 1. Primary Source Hierarchy
- **Tier 1**: Original research, official documents, direct witnesses
- **Tier 2**: Peer-reviewed academic papers, established news organizations
- **Tier 3**: Expert opinions, verified secondary sources
- **Tier 4**: Social media posts, unverified claims, opinion pieces

### 2. Red Flags for Misinformation
- Emotional language designed to provoke reaction
- Claims that seem "too good/bad to be true"
- Lack of citations or verifiable sources
- Contradicts established scientific consensus without evidence
- Uses logical fallacies (ad hominem, strawman, false dichotomy)

### 3. Verification Techniques
- **Cross-Reference**: Check multiple independent sources
- **Date Verification**: Ensure currency and context of information
- **Author Credentials**: Verify expertise and potential bias
- **Publication Quality**: Assess credibility of publishing platform

### 4. Evidence Assessment
- **Strength of Evidence**: Anecdotal < Observational < Experimental
- **Sample Size**: Larger, more diverse samples are more reliable
- **Replication**: Has the finding been reproduced independently?
- **Peer Review**: Has the work been scrutinized by experts?
